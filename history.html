		<br>
		  <p>Lolita fashion takes its main inspirations from Victorian England and French Rococo. To understand where it all began, we need to go back to the 1980s. 
			Kawaii culture was popular all over Japan and a romanticised image of France was trendy among the youth. For many girls at that time, focusing on their own 
			interests and femininity helped them to cope with a patriarchal system. Consuming products associated with the aesthetic gave them some form of personal freedom. 
			Fashion brands such as Milk, Pink House and Pretty picked up on this mood and they became popular among many girls in Harajuku. Also at that time, famous British 
			designer Vivienne Westwood opened her first shop in Harajuku. This made it possible for these girls to incorporate her designs into their outfits. Think of 
			her iconic rocking horse shoes seen in many Lolita outfits even today.</p>

		<p>In the 80s, popular magazine Olive influenced these trends by featuring Milk and Pink House and promoting a “French lifestyle”. Olive’s readers were sold an 
			idyllic world full of romance and kawaii. The lifestyle and brands featured in Olive paved the way for later popular Lolita brands. Akinori Isobe who worked 
			for Atsuki Onishi, a popular brand, founded the now well-known Lolita brand Baby, the Stars Shine Bright. Until Baby came around in the late 80s, Lolita was 
			not an established style. Especially forerunner brands such as Milk and Pink House, who promoted a more modest look compared to Lolita. Think of soft colours, 
			floral patterns and long skirts with lace. We didn’t see Lolita essentials like petticoats or headdresses just yet. Baby’s connection to Olive and its French 
			Rococo inspiration makes it clear that the beginnings of Lolita can be traced back to the 70s French kawaii aesthetic, combined with Westwood’s British punk 
			designs.</p>
		
		<p>Comparing Lolita with the western Goth movement, it is easy to draw parallels. Both Lolita and Goth are marked by striking fashion, a rejection of societal values and 
			expectations, and “a longing to escape to another world.” However, whereas Lolita incorporates the 'cuteness' found in more mainstream fashion, Goth fashion intends to 
			both reject and parody mainstream fashion and good taste, aiming for a dichotomy between beauty and repulsion. Additionally, while Lolita generally emphasises childlike 
			innocence and purity, which tends to be expressed in 'sweetness' and optimism, Goth veers more towards morbidity, sexual fetishism and pessimism. Even Gothic Lolita, 
			which shares with western Goth a fascination with religious imagery and victorian nostalgia, still shares the ethos of Lolita that is a yearning for a carefree, 
			whimsical world akin to Rococo. In contrast, Goths emphasise their separation from mainstream culture by yearning for tragedy and the “darkly powerful”, finding beauty 
			in the darker side of life. These differences mean that if one were to compare a Lolita with a Goth, both would strenuously disagree.</p>

		<p>Lolita fashion appears at first glance not only to be a rejection of societal expectations in favour of a luxurious, responsibility-free life, but of the homogeneity 
			of most Japanese culture and society. Until the mid-60s, most women shared a common beauty ideology, and even today the kawaii aesthetic permeates most mainstream 
			fashion. In contrast, Lolita offers distinction and individualism from the normal fashion style. However, upon closer examination, Lolita has a distinctly paradoxical 
			nature towards individuality of style. While it is true that it offers individuality from the mainstream, it still maintains strict rules about coordination and 
			combinations of style. Additionally, brand clothing is generally offered in only one or two sizes, often very small and designed for the flat-chested, short and 
			thin Japanese girl. In this way, Lolita maintains homogeneity of style and appearance even while it simultaneously offers an opportunity to break away from mainstream 
			fashion. While Lolitas may be alone in smaller rural areas, as is depicted in Shimotsuma Monogatari, Tokyo Lolitas gather in groups in Harajuku, many wearing matching 
			outfits. This conformation and group ethos reflects the larger Japanese group culture and allows people to feel a part of a group or subculture even when they do not 
			fit into the norm.</p>

			<p>Since there are really no surviving online pictures of pieces of what it is Baby and Angelic Pretty were selling in the 80's, there's a big black hole in the history of 
				the Lolita fashion. The earliest we have hard proof that people were actually wearing such things are the earliest volumes of the Fruits magazine. If you are unfamiliar 
				with Fruits, it is a magazine that began in 1997 of street snaps in the Harajuku district. Kera magazine, the publication that the Gothic & Lolita Bibles are a spin-off 
				of, was first published in 1998, and if they have any pictures of Lolita brands that would be an awesome source of what Lolita brands were selling, not just what a select 
				few were wearing, sadly I could not get my hands on any of those early Kera magazines.</p>

			<p>In the 1990s, Lolita saw its popularity soar. Brands experimented with punk and classical elements, Misako Aoki started her career modelling for street fashion 
				magazine KERA, and FRUiTS started taking Street Snaps of Lolitas in Tokyo. During this time of popularity, the word “Lolita” was first being associated with the 
				fashion. There are plenty of theories surrounding the name and even designers from that time don’t know the exact truth. The 90s marked the beginnings of Gothic 
				Lolita style, created by Visual Kei guitarist Mana-sama. He created a link between Visual Kei aesthetic and a dark Victorian twist on Lolita. His fans, formerly 
				dressed in Milk and Pink House fashion, were able to get the full Mana look by shopping at his own brand Moi-meme-Moitie. The brand’s initial two lines, Elegant 
				Gothic Lolita (EGL) and Elegant Gothic Aristocrat (EGA), influenced Lolita for decades to come. Also at this time, clear elements of Lolita fashion were established. 
				Think of aprons, Mary Janes, blouses, small petticoats, fringes and headdresses with popular colour combinations including white, black, pink and sax. For Gothic Lolita, 
				long aristocratic coats and dresses, petticoats, platform heels, and heavy makeup characterised the look. From designers to models to consumers, everyone helped to 
				establish the fashion’s basic silhouette and rules.</p>
	
			<p>On a Sunday afternoon in Harajuku, Tokyo, one is likely to spot a girl or two who stands out a little incongruously among the crowd of brightly-dressed youths. 
				While her peers are wearing jeans, miniskirts and even colourful printed yukata (traditional cotton kimono worn in summer), she's more likely to be wearing a 
				dress you would expect to see in a victorian fashion plate – lacy and black, or perhaps a pastel pink, combined with petticoats, platform Mary Jane shoes and a bow 
				in her hair. What is this fashion or subculture, and how does it reflect Japanese society and culture? Will it evolve in the future, or is it a static snapshot of 
				twenty-first century youth rebellion? And how does it compare to the more well-known western Goth subculture? This essay will cover these aspects in explaining the 
				Gothic and Lolita phenomenon and those who are drawn to it.Lolita began in Harajuku, Tokyo in the 1980s when Omotesando and Takeshita-dori, streets in the Harajuku 
				district, were closed to traffic on Sundays. This closure allowed youths to gather in Yoyogi Park and the surrounding streets to listen to rock music performances, 
				shop and simply spend time among other young people. Youths and street performers started appearing in wild, unconventional outfits which gradually developed into 
				recognisable styles such as Lolita, Gyaru or Kogal, Decora and Ganguro. These styles were catalogued by a street photographer, Shoichi Aoki, in his magazines STREET, 
				started in 1985, and FRUiTS, started in 1997. Photographs from FRUiTS have now been released as a compilation in a book of the same title and toured both Australia and 
				New Zealand as a photography exhibition, allowing westerners a glimpse of this “grass roots” Japanese street fashion movement. Lolita fashion was popularised with the 
				establishment of brands such as Baby, The Stars Shine Bright in 1988 and Manifesteange Metamorphose Temps de Fille in 1993.</p>

		<p>Other brands include Angelic Pretty, Innocent World and Mary Magdalene. While most brands cater to the Japanese market, the advent of western interest in the Lolita 
			subculture has meant that some brands have begun selling to Northern American and other western countries; some brands such as Metamorphose have developed english-language 
			websites to cater to this interest. Primarily, however, brands still aim their clothing at Japanese girls in their teens to mid-twenties. Stylistic influences for Lolita 
			fashion spring from a variety of eras, the most easily recognisable being the victorian era. The fashion is more akin to children's clothes from this era than adults'; 
			skirts generally fall around knee-length rather than the full floor-length gowns, and the exaggerated wasp-waist corsets are not often worn. Influences are also taken 
			from other eras such as the 1950s and the french Rococo style, but while Lolita has a historical look and feel, it is not from any particular period and tends to blend 
			multiple historical looks together for its own individual and recognisable Lolita style. The Lolita style has since developed into multiple substyles, the most notable 
			being Gothic Lolita (known in Japan as gosurori, a contraction of the phrase 'Gothic Lolita'). Where traditional Lolitas wear pastel colours, embroidered cotton prints 
			and lace, and sometimes carry toys such as porcelain dolls or teddy-bears, the Gothic Lolita is more likely to wear black lace, monotone black, grey or white dresses, 
			and crosses or crucifixes in a style more akin to western Goth. However, the main emphasis is still on victorian styling; it “combines aspects of a victorian girl's 
			attire with a dark Gothic mood.” This style has been popularised by Japanese visual rock bands such as Dir En Grey and Malice Mizer; Mana, the leader of Malice Mizer, 
			has established his own store named Moi-Meme-Moitie, which sells a distinct style known as Elegant Gothic Lolita. Other styles include Punk, Sweet (with even more pink, 
			baby blue or white and a surfeit of lace) and Classic. Some followers of the fashion choose to combine Lolita with other popular street fashions, leading to hybrid 
			styles such as Cyber Lolita or Wa Lolita, where a traditional Japanese aesthetic reflected in the kimono-style garment is combined with the bell-shaped skirt and 
			headdress worn by Lolitas, but the most popular styles remain Sweet, Classic and Gothic.</p>
		<p>For whatever reason, be it the popularity of Visual-kei bands or simply the fashion finally spread to Harajuku, Lolita seems to explode in popularity as soon as the 90's 
			are over. Once this elusive Lolita was finally captured, in all her glory, in the camera's lens she becomes a world-wide phenomena. Not only does she become much more 
			frequently sighted, but her outfits are much more well put together. Dresses are more often from a brand instead of handmade (which is debatable whether or not this is a 
			good thing) and they are also better fitting. This new Lolita has a much more defined look and silhouette.</p>

<br>
		<p>Lolita as a fashion and a subculture is easy to categorise as a static rebellion of Japanese girls against expected societal roles and appearance. However, to file it 
			away as such a phenomenon is to ignore that, twenty years after the establishment of the style, it not only still exists but is spreading both in Japan and to the western 
			world, in no small part through the power of the Internet. Online forums now exist for western Lolitas to discuss the fashion, share photos and even sell or trade items; 
			one of the most popular has nearly 7000 members from all over the world. Due to this worldwide interest, brands such as Baby, The Stars Shine Bright are establishing 
			overseas stores; Baby has opened a store in Paris and is due to open another in San Francisco. Furthermore, western Lolita brands which cater to the different size and 
			shape of western women are developing, although none have yet reached the same level as Japanese brand stores. While some adherents of the fashion believe that the 
			growing popularity will create bastardisations of the style that so many love, others point out that as Lolita reaches the mainstream, the clothing will not only be 
			more available but more affordable. While Lolita may have begun as a fashion for Japanese girls who wished to step away from sexual fashion, reject societal expectations 
			and revel in a world of luxury and individualism within a group of like-minded friends, it will continue to evolve into a fashion and a lifestyle loved worldwide as 
			women simply enjoy “being a princess” in a modern-day society.</p>

		<p>Whether Lolita is a fashion or a subculture is a matter of some discussion among followers. Many women wear the style only on weekends and for concerts, possibly as 
			a form of escape from their more prosaic everyday lives and of course, simply because it's 'cute'. Other women say that Lolita is a lifestyle, and even when not 
			wearing the clothes, they try to incorporate the Lolita ethos into their everyday lives. Momoko, a character from the novel Shimotsuma Monogatari ('A Shimotsuma 
			Story', translated into English and published as Kamikaze Girls) by Lolita novelist Novala Takemoto, expresses the wish that she could live in the carefree, whimsical 
			and hedonistic Rococo era. No matter whether a Lolita wears the style simply as a fashion or sees it as a lifestyle, the culture of Lolita is an escape to a fantasy 
			world free of pressures of modern-day society and adulthood. While Japanese women of today have wider societal roles than those of their mothers, they are still 
			expected to enter employment only until marriage and childbirth, and while employed they are generally placed in lower roles than men. It is still common for a 
			young woman to be employed as a greeter or elevator girl at a department store, or as the “office lady” asked to make tea and photocopy documents at a corporation. 
			Additionally, Japanese culture emphasises the importance of motherhood as a “sacred mission” and discourages women from pursuing a career as it distracts her from 
			her main task of motherhood and running the family home. Thus girls and women who wear Lolita are rejecting the societal expectation of low-importance careers and 
			homemaking in favour of a fantasy in which they can “fulfill their own sense of princess-like aesthetic beauty” and avoid growing up in a more mundane world.</p>
			
		<p>This rejection of societal norms by Lolitas reflects the rise in Japanese society of young people, especially women, known as 'parasite singles'. Millions of young 
			Japanese are choosing to stay living with their parents into their twenties and even thirties, working for a living but spending their income on material items and 
			refusing to get married or have children. Lolita fashion is expensive; items from brand stores range from one hundred to five hundred dollars, and a full outfit may 
			cost as much as a thousand dollars. The fashion began in the eighties, reflecting the affluence of Japanese society created by the 'Bubble Economy'. Due to the 
			youthful nature of Lolita fashion, many girls are supported by their parents in their buying habits, but for others in their twenties, the only way to continue 
			buying such items is to remain living in the family home and use discretionary income to buy clothes, rather than establish one's own independent life. It is 
			possible, but difficult, to become a Lolita without spending exorbitant sums of money; some women learn to sew their own clothes or choose to buy from lesser-
			known 'indie' or independent brands. However, most Japanese girls will agree that in order to be accepted and respected by other Lolitas, it is necessary to 
			buy some brand clothing. This aspect of the Lolita phenomenon reflects the obsession with brands found elsewhere in Japanese society. Other parasite singles 
			may buy expensive brand-name handbags or jewellery. As Professor Masahiro Yamada, who coined the phrase, states, on average women lose two-thirds of their spending 
			money when they marry. The rise of parasite singles does not surprise the sociology professor, who also attributes their prevalence to Japan's affluence during the 
			1980s. Despite the downturn in Japan's economy during the 90s, it appears that both Lolitas and other Japanese youth have discovered one way to maintain their high 
			discretionary spending and affluent lifestyle.</p>

			<h5>Lolita and Feminism</h5>
			<h2>And not the *Nabokov* kind</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="css/images/femi.png">
<br>
<br>
	
		<p>Is Lolita fashion related to the 1958 novel Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov or the film directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1962? The simple answer is no, not at all. Here is a more 
			complex answer: On hearing the word Lolita, many English speakers tend to think about the film or novel and thus make an association to the sexual and erotic aspects of these 
			works. Many people who wear this fashion in North America are often asked if “Lolita fashion” is in any way sexual. Even when told it is in no way connected to the novel or 
			the film, the cultural association is so strong that some have a difficult time processing this information.</p>

		<p>It is important to remember that the novel is told from the perspective of Humbert Humbert. Dolores does not have a voice—the reader does not know her thoughts or feelings. 
			Humbert tells the story, Humbert is the one who sexualizes Dolores when he calls her Lolita and a nymphet. Prior to the novel, Lolita was the nickname for Dolores and did 
			not have the nymphet connotations.</p>

		<p>During a conversation I had with Nagisa, a Japanese Lolita from Osaka, we talked about the differences between Lolicon, Japanese for “Lolita complex” or the sexualization 
			of young girls, and Lolita fashion, a youthful street style worn mostly by women. The “Lolita” in these two different concepts are considered unrelated and are defined and 
			approached differently by men and women. The “Lolita” in Lolicon is defined by male gaze and desire that is directed toward prepubescent girls. Men project their sexual 
			desire upon Lolita, wanting to take advantage of and control her. In contrast, for women Lolita fashion exists as a domain removed from the sphere of cis-male influence. 
			Lolita has agency, feelings, and power. She is a reminder of a woman’s own precious childhood memories growing up as a girl.</p>

		<p>What is considered beautiful or cute in Lolita fashion is separate from mainstream tastes and trends. It’s about dressing for your own enjoyment, not dressing for others. 
			In other words, it is a self-centered undertaking, an activity of adornment that is not connected to socially productive presentations of self that achieve a goal such as 
			dressing to get a job, dressing to get a boyfriend, dressing to go to school, dressing to fit in, et cetera. Well, I suppose the goal here is to feel happy and beautiful 
			on your own terms. Lolita is a modest style. Lolitas dress for themselves. It is clothing that reminds us that not everything has to do with trying to attract or please 
			men.</p>
